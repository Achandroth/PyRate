PyRate is a Python program to estimate speciation, extinction, and preservation rates from fossil occurrence data using a Bayesian framework. The method was described here:

Silvestro D., Salamin N., Schnitzler J. (2014) PyRate: A new program to estimate speciation and extinction rates from incomplete fossil record. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 5, 1126-1131.

The model with fixed shift times and Cauchy hyper-priors on the birth-death rates is described here:
